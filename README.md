UiGEN Core 
=====================

1. UiGEN is a solution for Wordpress to build websites using predefined blocks.
2. It has a GUI for placing those blocks and an API to create new blocks.
3. It's aimed at rapid development of landing pages, websites, portals, CRM, custom eCommerce solutions or Facebook applications, but you can create pretty much any web app with it.
4. Blocks are storad on external repository. We will shortly launch our repo, but you will also have ability to run your own (praviate).
5. UiGEN is fully custonized with on-site GUI.
6. Since UiGEN is a WordPress plugin - its using WordPress API and is compatibile with other WordPress plugins. (for example one of blocks is ContactForm7 block or NextgenGallery block)
7. UiGEN default frontend theme is based on Twitter Bootstrap CSS framework.
8. UiGEN can create database relations, frontend posttypes manager and forms with custom buisness logic flow.
9. MockupMe is UiGEN satelite project to generate prototype site from SVG files.
