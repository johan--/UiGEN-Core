      But I must explain to you how all this
      mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and
      praising pain was born and I will give
      you a complete account of the system,
      and expound the actual teachings of the
      great explorer of the truth, the
      master-builder of human happiness. No
      one rejects, dislikes, or avoids
      pleasure itself, because it is pleasure,
      but because those who do not know how to
      pursue pleasure rationally encounter
      consequences that are extremely painful.
      Nor again is there anyone who loves or
      pursues or desires to obtain pain of
      itself, because it is pain, but because
      occasionally circumstances occur in
      which toil and pain can procure him some
      great pleasure. To take a trivial
      example, which of us ever undertakes
      laborious physical exercise, except to
      obtain some advantage from it? But who
      has any right to find fault with a man
      who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has
      no annoying consequences, or one who
      avoids a pain that produces no resultant
      pleasure?
